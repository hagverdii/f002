# Lab 1 Project

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates the basic structure of an HTML document and how to link a CSS stylesheet for styling.

## Project Structure

```
lab1
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── README.md
```

## Files Description

- **index.html**: Contains the default HTML boilerplate structure, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. It links to the `style.css` file for styling.
  
- **style.css**: This file is intended for styling the HTML content. It is currently empty but can be filled with CSS rules to style the elements in `index.html`.

## Usage

To view the project, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can modify the `style.css` file to change the appearance of the web page.
